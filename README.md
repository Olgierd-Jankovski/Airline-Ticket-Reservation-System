# Airline-Ticket-Reservation-System
This project implements a 4th normal form (4NF) database using Postgres and enables communication with the database using Java. It is console-based flight booking system, which allows users to search for flights, book flights, view booked flights and cancel booked flights. The database schema includes tables for flights, users and tickets.

The project has several features, including the ability to search for flights based on departure and arrival locations and dates, book a flight and choose a seat, view booked flights for a specific user, cancel a booked flight. The system also includes validation checks to ensure that users enter valid input and to prevent them from booking or canceling tickets that don't belong to them. The system is also resistant to SQL injections by using parameterized queries.

TO use the system, users can run the main program and follow the prompts to search for available flights, book a flight, view booked flights, or canccel a booked flight. The system will provide feedback to the user at each step, including confirmation of booked or canceled flights.

Overall, this project provides a basic flight booking system that can be expanded and customized as needed. It is designed to be easy to use and to provide a good starting point for building more complex flight booking systems.
